Pitch: 

    Our group would like to create a multi level escape room game where players 
    navigate through a maze, interact with puzzles and keys, and fight enemies with weapons 
    and bullets that they pick up. 

Requirements:

Requirement 1: The project must incorporate some visual interface using Processing.org libraries. All user interaction must be conducted via this interface.

    We will be creating an interactive window with Sprites, arrow controls  and possibly mouse click events.

Requirement 2: The project must incorporate some kind of non-blocking concurrent/asynchronous processing that happens at regular intervals. For example, you might push or fetch data from in the background.

    We would like to incorporate game APIs for the puzzles and constantly update the game state to the database.
    Game state refers to player's level, position, item positions, etc.

Requirement 3: The project must incorporate some kind of non-trivial persistent data state that must be read, processed, and written at regular intervals. For example, you might save a game state in a JSON file. This may or may not be included with Requirement 2.

    We will have a data structure that will keep track of the level and location of the player and enemies. 
    The levels will have different game states which will have more complex puzzles etc.

Requirement 4: The project must incorporate some kind of self-managing custom iterable data structure. For example, you might have a collection of enemies that are added and deleted based on statistics maintained by the data structure.
Iterable structure

    Our game will have a set number of enemies based on the level and delete them based on player statistics. 
    We would like to include weapons and bullets that can be picked up by the player, and the number of bullets would be set based on the level as well.

Requirement 5: The project must be well-documented, complete, and run without errors on final submission.

    We will push every week to Github and set group meeting (Tuesdays after school) reminders every week on Discord. 
    Weâ€™ll also  write meaningful commit messages. Also we will make weekly goals to ensure that we do not fall behind with the project.


Meeting time and format: when will you meet and how?

    We will meet at least once a week depending on availability it will be in person or over discord. 
    Tuesdays after school for at least 30 mins.

Communications expectations and format: what times of day are people available and by which medium?

    Our rules are that we should ensure to respond to messages asap, trying to get back to group members 
    within one day unless there are serious circumstances in which you cannot respond.
    
Roles and responsibilities: who will do what part of the group aspects of the project, 

    Roles:

Abilities and expectations: how much effort do people want to put into the project and in what areas do they have expertise?

    Everyone should do an equal amount, and people will be helping each other in complicated tasks. 
    We are aiming to learn new technologies and produce a 
    Chelsey and Ebony have talent in drawing/graphic design.
